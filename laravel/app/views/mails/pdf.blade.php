<p><span class="under">Question</span> - May I bring a pet on a scheduled flight?<br></p>

<li><span>Answer -</span> One dog is allowed per flight, however, due to the size of our aircraft,
 some dogs may not be able to fly with us. One cat is allowed per flight provided it is kept in a
  carrier for the entirety of the flight. Reservations of pets must be made in advance, please
   check with us at the time of booking. Allies Air reserves the right to deny or cancel a pet reservation.</li>


<p><span class="under">Question</span> - What if my flight is delayed or cancelled?<br></p>

<li><span>Answer -</span>If your scheduled flight is delayed or cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances
 such as weather or a mechanical issue, our team will do the absolute best to reschedule
  you on different flight/aircraft. If you decide to decline our reschedule proposal,
   we will refund the full amount of your gift card.</li>


<p><span class="under">Question</span> - What if I'm late?</p>

<li><span>Answer -</span> If you are late for a scheduled flight, we unfortunately cannot hold the aircraft
 for longer than its designated departure time.</li>


<p><span class="under">Question</span> - What luggage may I bring?</p>

<li><span>Answer -</span> Each passenger is allowed one carry-on item such as a small purse, camera case,
bag for food and drink. Additionally, each passenger is allowed one piece of checked baggage
 so long as it is no larger than 9 inches x 14 inches x  22 inches and/or weighs less than 35
  pounds. Unfortunately, we most likely cannot transport larger in size or odd in shape luggage
   (golf bags, skiis, baby strollers, etc.) due to the size of our aircraft. Note - All baggage
    tendered to Allies Air for transportation either as checked baggage or as carry-on baggage is
    subject to inspection for security and safety reasons.  Passengers and their baggage are subject
     to inspection with or without the passengerâ€™s consent or knowledge.</li>


<p><span class="under">Question</span> - What if I need to bring a golf bag, baby stroller, or other large item?</p>

<li><span>Answer -</span> We will do everything we can to accommodate your larger items on the flight you are taking.
If we have a full plane and cannot fit your larger items, please call our team (508) 231-5801 or email
 info@alliesair.com to coordinate transportation of your items on our sister company, Allies Air Freight!</li>


<p><span class="under">Question</span> - May passengers with disabilities, including those with wheelchairs, fly with you?</p>

<li><span>Answer -</span> Of course we welcome passengers with disabilities to fly with us! Passengers
should understand that the aircraft we operate are small and require each person to climb
 into the aircraft using two steps and do not offer ramps or lifts for boarding. Each passenger
 must be able to board and deplane using the steps. The foregoing is consistent with federal regulations
  applicable to all aircraft having a passenger capacity less than 19.</li>
