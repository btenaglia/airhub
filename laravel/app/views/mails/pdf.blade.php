Frequently Asked Questions:

Question - May I bring a pet on a scheduled flight?

Answer - One dog is allowed per flight, however, due to the size of our aircraft, some dogs may not be able to fly with us. One cat is allowed per flight provided it is kept in a carrier for the entirety of the flight. Reservations of pets must be made in advance, please check with us at the time of booking. Allies Air reserves the right to deny or cancel a pet reservation.


Question - What if my flight is delayed or cancelled?

Answer - If your scheduled flight is delayed or cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather or a mechanical issue, our team will do the absolute best to reschedule you on different flight/aircraft. If you decide to decline our reschedule proposal, we will refund the full amount of your gift card.


Question - What if I'm late?

Answer - If you are late for a scheduled flight, we unfortunately cannot hold the aircraft for longer than its designated departure time. 


Question - What luggage may I bring?

Answer - Each passenger is allowed one carry-on item such as a small purse, camera case, bag for food and drink. Additionally, each passenger is allowed one piece of checked baggage so long as it is no larger than 9 inches x 14 inches x  22 inches and/or weighs less than 35 pounds. Unfortunately, we most likely cannot transport larger in size or odd in shape luggage (golf bags, skiis, baby strollers, etc.) due to the size of our aircraft. Note - All baggage tendered to Allies Air for transportation either as checked baggage or as carry-on baggage is subject to inspection for security and safety reasons.  Passengers and their baggage are subject to inspection with or without the passengerâ€™s consent or knowledge.


Question - What if I need to bring a golf bag, baby stroller, or other large item?

Answer - We will do everything we can to accommodate your larger items on the flight you are taking. If we have a full plane and cannot fit your larger items, please call our team (508) 231-5801 or email info@alliesair.com to coordinate transportation of your items on our sister company, Allies Air Freight! 


Question -May passengers with disabilities, including those with wheelchairs, fly with you?

Answer - Of course we welcome passengers with disabilities to fly with us! Passengers should understand that the aircraft we operate are small and require each person to climb into the aircraft using two steps and do not offer ramps or lifts for boarding. Each passenger must be able to board and deplane using the steps. The foregoing is consistent with federal regulations applicable to all aircraft having a passenger capacity less than 19.
